  <p>I am an aspiring Data Analyst and former Chemist with newly acquired skills (proficient in Python, 
    Excel, SQL, etc.) and insatiable intellectual curiosity.  Leveraging my background in mathematics, 
    applied statistics, with visualization and exploration, I can find hidden gems within large sets of 
    data, structured or raw.  I am seeking employment as a data analyst or data scientist and am 
    available to relocate.  I bring both technical ability as well as strong communication and teamwork 
    skills.
  </p>

  <p>I am an alum of the University of Wisconsin and Rutgers University.  I am an Eagle Scout and former 
    Vice President of the Madison Chapter of the American Outlaws.  My outside interests include history, 
    politics, and science fiction/fantasy.
